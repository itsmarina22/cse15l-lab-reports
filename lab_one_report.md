## Workspace Commands
cd
--
* Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
  * A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
    > ![Image](cd_with_no_arguments.JPG)
  * What the working directory was when the command was run
    > /home
  * A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
    > The output is observed because cd specifically is used to switch the current working directory to a given specified path. No path was provided to cd in the argument, so as a result, no output was generated or observed
  * Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it's an error, explain why it's an error.
    > This is not an error and is the expected output

* Share an example of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
  * A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
    > ![Image](cd_with_path_to_directory.JPG)
  * What the working directory was when the command was run
    > /home/lecture1
  * A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
    > cd specifically is used to switch the current working directory to a given specified path. A path to lecture1 has been specified, so now the working directory of the prompt is /home/lecture1
  * Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it's an error, explain why it's an error.
    > This is not an error and is the expected output

* Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
  * A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
      > ![Image](cd_with_path_to_a_file.JPG)
  * What the working directory was when the command was run
    > in the first time cd Hello.java was used, the working directory is /home
    > in the second time cd Hello.java was used, the working directory is /home/lecture1
  * A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
    > for the first time cd Hello.java, the error was produced because Hello.java isn't a file or directory or path that is present within /home
    > for the second time cd Hello.java, now we have switched to the path that contains Hello.java, thus the file does exist; however, Hello.java is a file and not a directory or path. cd requires specifying a desired path or directory to go to
  * Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it's an error, explain why it's an error.
    > This is not an error and is the expected output
