Using the command line, show with ls and take screenshots of:

* The absolute path to the private key for your SSH key for logging into ieng6 (on your computer, an EdStem workspace, or on the home directory of the lab computer)
* The absolute path to the public key for your SSH key for logging into ieng6 (this is the one you copied to your account on ieng6, so it should be a path on ieng6's file system)
